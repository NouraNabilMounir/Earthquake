Earthquake and how to act during one An earthquake is a sudden shake of the surface of the earth caused by a sudden release of energy in the earth’s lithosphere which creates seismic waves .the earthquakes happens for multiple reasons like induced earthquake which caused by human activity, volcanic earthquake, collapse earthquake.

Earthquake can range in intensity from those that are too weak to even feel to those destructive like the ones that happened in Syria and turkey. Earthquake can also trigger another catastrophe natural disasters like tsunamis, landslides, and fires not only that it can effect on the sustainable development which can reduce the disaster’s risk and casualties it stands for ability of buildings or civil engineering structure to perform their basic operational functions. An aftershocks is an earthquake that happens after the previous earthquake, the stress from the earthquake is the main reason of these aftershocks. The first scale of measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed in 1935 by Charles Francis Richter, the scales used to describe the size of earthquake began in the 1930s

Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science seismology and it predicted the place and time and that can save a lot of souls and avoid casualties The hardest earthquake that ever happened is the Valdivia,chille earthquake in 22 may 1960,it occurred in the afternoon and lasted for 10 minutes it was recorded that it was 9.4-9.6 the time it occurred the casualties was 1,000-6000 The latest earthquake happened in turkey and Syria on February 6,2023 the max intensity was 11(X|) and the casualties were horrible over 23,420 deaths and 84,990 injured.

How to act during an earthquake if you’re inside your car stop as fast as you can and stay in, if you were inside your house stay away from everything that falls or breaks like windows and don’t use elevators use the emergency exit stay in and hide under a table or your bed, if you were outside the house stay out don’t try to enter a close space and stay away from buildings, trees and ,if you were unlucky and got stuck under the collapse don’t light a match and cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or a piece of fabric and always help each other. There are more ways to avoid dealing with earthquake like the earthquake proof-bed that looks like a coffin it uses an activation trigger from a sensory box that consists of accelerometers, gyro sensor, microcontrollers and unidirectional tunnel movement sensor For more information or ways how to deal during an earthquake or helping please visit the next websites:
